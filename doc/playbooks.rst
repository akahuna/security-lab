Ansible Playbooks
=================

There are tools out there which are very useful but not all of those tools are available through the package management system. The Fedora Security Lab provides various playbooks to close that gap without violating any Fedora guidelines. The playbooks simplify the installation process (meaning: no more copy-and-paste from the Fedora wiki), provide support while setup and configuration, let you use tools with a very fast development (like metasploit), and add additional features.

​- Packages playbook for a quick installation of all Security Lab packages.
​- Additional nmap scripts like the one for Heartbleed.
- metasploit
- set (social engineer toolkit)
​- spiderfoot is an open source footprinting tool
​- fimap is tool for local and remote file inclusion auditing and exploitation
​- arachni
- etc...


Try when ever possible to bring the tools into the ​Fedora Package Collection.
